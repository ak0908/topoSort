1)List.c 
This is the Implementation file for Linked List ADT. 

2)List.h
This is the header file for Linked List ADT.

3)Digraph.c
This is the implementation file for Digraph ADT. There are 3 main function in my Digraph ADT.

4)Digraph.h
This is the header file for Digraph ADT

5)DigraphProperties.c	
This is a test file for Digraph ADT

6)Makefile
This is the Makefile for PA 4 assignment.


### Data Structure

In my DigraphObj struct besides the ones provided to me (numVertices, numEdges and the array of Lists of outgoing neighbors) These following filed also included:
	int* arrayInt;        
	int* arrayTime;      
	int* arrayFinishTime;  
	int* arrayDistance;    
	int* arrayIndegree;    

!!! Special data fileds used in this PA4 to make SCC more efficient:
   bool cleanGraph;   // A graph would be considered CLEAN if there isn't 
   					  // any modification since last SCC function call.

   int numSCC;        // this is my number of SCC components

   List* SSCList;     // This List array would store the SSC Componets as 
   					  // Lists. It will get recalcualted if the Graph 
   		              // isn't clean.

!!! WHY my SSC Algorithm is efficient:
Everytime my PA4 encounters a SSC question, my PA4 first check if the this Digarph has changed by using G->cleanGraph. If not, my program
wouldn't compute SCC since they are stored in my G->SCCList[i] and G->numSCC.  If yes, then compute SCC.





### USAGE

<make >              makes DigraphProperties executable


./DigraphProperties <input> <output>
This command will output all ther result to the output file


<make clean> command will remove unnecessary files in PA 2 folder
